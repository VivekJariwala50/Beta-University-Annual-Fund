# Beta University Annual Fund DBMS Project

## Overview

The Beta University Annual Fund DBMS Project is a comprehensive database system designed to manage the university’s fundraising efforts. The system handles donation pledges, payment methods, donor categories, fundraising events, and much more. The project was created to streamline donation tracking, payment management, and event organization for Beta University’s fundraising team.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to develop a functional and scalable database for Beta University's Annual Fund. This database will assist in tracking donations, categorizing donors, generating reports, and improving fundraising efficiency. Additionally, this project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in working independently while enhancing my analytical reasoning, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills.
